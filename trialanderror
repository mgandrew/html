  <h1>My First Webpage</h1>
  <p>Example paragraph. Yeah, it's kind of short. <br />All of this is currently coded in html. The following is a list.</p>
  <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">This is where I learned to code.</a>
  <ul>
    <li>Item one.
    <li>Item two.
    <li>Item three.
  </ul>
  <p>Even better, here's an ordered (numbered) list.<br />Hopefully looking back on this code helps me in the future.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>This is hard.
    <li>But super fun.
    <li>I'm excited to learn more.
    <li>The following is a bear.
  </ol>
